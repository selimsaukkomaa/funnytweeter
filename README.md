# Hauskaoskari - A twitter bot project ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

Hauskaoskari is a bot that adds the :joy: emoji (ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚) at the end of every tweet by finnish journalist Oskari Onninen. ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

It has **no purpose whatsoever** other than to be funny. ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

Note: A file called config.js is referenced in bot.js. **This file contains the Twitter api keys** and as such is obviously included in the .gitignore file.

This bot was built with the fantastic youtube tutorial by Daniel Shiffman, found at https://youtu.be/RF5_MPSNAtU .
