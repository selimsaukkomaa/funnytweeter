# Funnytweeter - A pretty dumb twitter bot project ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Funnytweeter is a bot that adds the :joy: emoji at the end of every tweet by a specified user. Why? Because :joy: makes everything seem very funny. Probably. Who knows.

This thing has **no purpose whatsoever** other than to be funny.

Note: A file called config.js is referenced in funnytweet.js. **This file contains the Twitter api keys** and as such is obviously included in the .gitignore file.

Special thanks to Daniel Shiffman and his very informative video series on the Twit package and Twitter API: https://youtu.be/RF5_MPSNAtU.
