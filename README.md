# Funnytweeter - A pretty dumb twitter bot project ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Funnytweeter is a bot that adds the :joy: emoji at the end of every tweet by a specified user. Why? Because :joy: makes everything seem very funny. Probably. Who knows.

This thing has **no purpose whatsoever** other than to be funny.

Note: A file called config.js is referenced in bot.js. **This file contains the Twitter api keys** and as such is obviously included in the .gitignore file.

This bot was built partly with the fantastic youtube tutorial by Daniel Shiffman, found at https://youtu.be/RF5_MPSNAtU.
