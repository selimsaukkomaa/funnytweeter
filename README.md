# Funnytweeter - A pretty dumb twitter bot project 😂😂😂

Funnytweeter is a bot that every two hours adds three :joy: emojis at the end of a random tweet by a specified user and then tweets it. Why? Because the :joy: emoji makes everything seem very funny. Probably. Who knows.

It was built as a learning project of both the Twitter API and Node.js. Right now you can see Funnytweeter in action here: https://twitter.com/hilarious_soren.

**Note:** A file called config.js contains the **Twitter API keys** that are required to make this bot actually post to Twitter. You can get yours from https://dev.twitter.com.
