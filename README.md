# Funnytweeter - A pretty dumb twitter bot project ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Funnytweeter is a bot that adds three :joy: emojis at the end of every tweet by a specified user. Why? Because the :joy: emoji makes everything seem very funny. Probably. Who knows.

This thing has **no purpose whatsoever** other than to be funny.

Note: A file called config.js contains the **Twitter API keys** that are required to make this bot actually post to Twitter. You can get yours from https://dev.twitter.com. 

Special thanks to Daniel Shiffman and his very informative video series on the Twit package and Twitter API: https://youtu.be/RF5_MPSNAtU.
